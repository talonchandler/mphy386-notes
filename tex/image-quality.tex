\section{X-ray Image Quality}
In this section we will introduce the basics of x-ray imaging and develop three
tools that we can use to quantify image quality---contrast, resolution, and
noise. We will focus on x-ray imaging in these notes, but these tools are
useful for analyzing all imaging modalities.
